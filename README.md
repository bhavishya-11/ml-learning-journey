# 🚀 Machine Learning Learning Journey  

Welcome to my **Machine Learning Learning Journey** repository!  
Here I document my progress as I learn ML — starting from the mathematical foundations to advanced deep learning concepts.  

---

## 📌 Roadmap  

### 1️⃣ Mathematics for ML  
- Linear Algebra (vectors, matrices, eigenvalues)  
- Probability & Statistics (distributions, Bayes theorem)  
- Calculus (derivatives, gradients)  

### 2️⃣ Python for Data Science  
- NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib  
- Exploratory Data Analysis  

### 3️⃣ Machine Learning Fundamentals  
- Supervised Learning (Regression, Classification, Trees)  
- Unsupervised Learning (Clustering, Dimensionality Reduction)  
- Model Evaluation (Bias-Variance tradeoff, Cross Validation)  

### 4️⃣ Deep Learning  
- Neural Networks basics  
- CNNs, RNNs, LSTMs  
- Transfer Learning  

### 5️⃣ Projects  
- ML from Scratch Implementations  
- Kaggle Practice  
- Real-world Applications

## 🎯 Goal  

By the end of this repo, I aim to:  
- Build **solid fundamentals** in ML & AI.  
- Create a collection of **notebooks & code** to revise quickly.  
- Showcase projects to recruiters.
